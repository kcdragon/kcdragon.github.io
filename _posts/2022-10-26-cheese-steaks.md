When I meet people at conferences and tell them I'm from Philadelphia, I'm often asked for my cheese steak recommendation.
I'll keep this post updated with my official rankings of cheese steaks in Philadelphia.

# [Mike's BBQ](https://www.mikesbbqphilly.com/)

Ranking: 1

My Order: Brisket Cheesesteak, Cooper Sharp Wiz, Raw Onions with a side of homemade potato chips

This is my favorite cheesesteak in the city right now.
It's not exactly traditional since it uses brisket instead of rib eye but their brisket is great.
They also have traditional BBQ food there so you can get some of that as well.
The biggest downside is their hours. They are only open from noon to 5pm and they will close early if they sell out.
They don't have much seating and the surrounding area is pretty residential so I would recommend ordering pick up and being flexible with where you eat it.
