[Liberty JS](http://www.libertyjs.com) is a regional JavaScript conference held in Philadelphia each year. This past weekend I attended the conference. There were a bunch of great talks I saw but I want to highlight two talks and the workshop I attended.

# React

At my new job at Zoomer, we are using React as the framework for a single page application. I decided to got to a talk and workshop on React to help with my work on the application at Zoomer.

On Day 1 of the conference, I saw Ken Rimple give a talk titled "React and Friends - Orienting yourself in Facebook's component API". This was an overview of the React framework and the other libraries in the ecosystem. Ken is a great speaker and did a great job communicating what's involved in a React-based web application.

I attended a workshop on the 2nd day of the conference for most of the afternoon. The workshop was lead by Mauricio Linhares and involved creating a Todo List app from scratch. I've seen Mauricio give a couple other talks in the Philadelphia area and they are always worthwhile.
