I'm a software developer from Philadelphia currently working with Java and React at [GrubHub].

I previously worked at [WebLinc](http://www.weblinc.com) developing e-commerce sites and [Zoomer](http://www.zoomerdelivery.com) developing food delivery applications.

I graduated from Drexel University in 2007 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
