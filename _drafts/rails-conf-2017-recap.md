I attended RailsConf this past April in Phoenix. It was held the week of April 25th. This is a post about my favorite talks of the conference.

# Opening Keynote - [@dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh)

DHH (David Heinemeier Hansson) did the opening keynote and did not disappoint. He talked about how developers like to think that they choose a technology (language, framework, etc) because they've evaluated it in comparison with others and it is the best fit for the given project, but usually developers choose a technology because they feel a part of that community and want to continue using it.ï»¿

If there's one talk you watch from the conference, I think this should be it. It was both entertaining and informative.
